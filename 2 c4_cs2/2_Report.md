# ðŸ’£ C4 Countdown Timer Simulation

## Project Overview

This project simulates a cinematic C4 explosive countdown timer using an Arduino Uno and a buzzer for sound effects. It utilizes the **`millis()`** function for non-blocking timing, which ensures the ticking sound is consistent and the LCD update is smooth, making the system highly responsive.

## ðŸ’» Program Functionality: C4 Ticking & BOOM

The program executes a multi-stage countdown sequence, controlled entirely by non-blocking timers.

### Key Features:

1.  **Non-Blocking Timing (`millis()`):**
    * The code is structured as a State Machine using `millis()` for all timing events. This ensures that the buzzer's ticking does not pause the core countdown logic, and the countdown value is accurate.
    * The main countdown updates once every second (1000 ms).

2.  **C4 Ticking Sound:**
    * A dedicated non-blocking timer controls the buzzer.
    * The buzzer is triggered to produce a brief **"TICK"** sound (using `tone()` and `noTone()`) precisely every 1000 milliseconds to simulate the C4 sound effect.

3.  **LCD Display:**
    * The 16x2 LCD displays the countdown value clearly on one line (e.g., "TIME LEFT: 00:09").
    * A custom message (e.g., "DETONATING IN T-5...") may be displayed on the second line or during the final critical phase.

4.  **Detonation Phase:**
    * When the countdown reaches zero, the system transitions into a final "Detonation" state.
    * The LCD displays a final message (e.g., "B O O M ! ! !").
    * The buzzer is activated with a sustained or complex tone sequence to simulate the "BOOM" sound, concluding the simulation.
